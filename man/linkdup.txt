NAME
  linkdup - create links between duplicate files
SYNOPSIS
  linkdup [-h|--help] [-V] [-v] [-r] [-s|-S] [-2] [-l SIZE] -d DIRECTORY
DESCRIPTION
  linkdup is a command line tool to find duplicate files, based in its hashes (MD5 or SHA256).

  The main goal of the linkdup is create relative symlinks to duplicate files. This is the main
  differential of the linkdup. However, it can create absolute links too, as the most similar commands.

  Optionally, linkdup allows recursive searches and can set a maximum file size to analyze. The link
  creation is optional; without this resource, linkdup will show the duplicated files and exit.
OPTIONS
  -h, --help    Show this help.
  -V            Show version.
  -v            Verbose. Works with -s or -S only.
  -r            Recursive.
  -s            Create relative symlinks. Do not use with -S.
  -S            Create absolute symlinks. Do not use with -s.
  -2            Use SHA256 hash instead of MD5 (MD5 is default, is faster).
  -l SIZE       The max file size used in search. Can be used bytes or 'k'
                for kilobyte, 'm' for megabytes and 'g' for gigabytes.
  -d DIRECTORY  Directory to be inspected. This option is MANDATORY.

  Without the -s or -S options, linkdup will only show the duplicate files.
EXAMPLES
  This command will analyze, recursively, the directory /test and create relative symlinks to duplicate files.

    $ linkdup -r -s -d /test

  This command will analyze, recursively, the directory /test, using SHA256 to compare files, and show the
  results. Files over 50 MB will be ignored. Symlinks will not be created.

    $ linkdup -r -2 -l 50M -d /test
